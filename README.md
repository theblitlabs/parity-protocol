## Getting Started

### System Requirements

Before beginning, ensure your system meets these prerequisites:

- **Go**: Version 1.22.7 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 14.0 or higher
- **Docker**: Latest stable version
- **Make**: Latest version
- **Git**: Latest version

### Installation Guide

#### 1. Repository Setup

```bash
mkdir parity-workspace && cd parity-workspace

# Clone core repositories
for repo in server runner client token wallet; do
    git clone https://github.com/theblitlabs/parity-${repo}.git
done
```

#### 2. Initial Configuration

```bash
# Set up token and wallet first
cd parity-token
# Follow README instructions for:
# 1. Token contract deployment
# 2. Parameter configuration
# 3. Initial distribution setup

cd ../parity-wallet
# Follow README instructions for:
# 1. Wallet infrastructure setup
# 2. Authentication configuration
# 3. Token contract integration

# Copy example configs for core components
for component in server runner client; do
    cp parity-${component}/.env.sample \
       parity-${component}/.env
done
```
##### Deployed Addresses

For reference, here are the current deployed addresses on Ethereum:

- **Stake Wallet Address**: `0x261259e9467E042DBBF372906e17b94fC06942f2`
- **Token Contract Address**: `0x844303bcC1a347bE6B409Ae159b4040d84876024`



#### 3. Component Configuration

Each component requires specific configuration. Follow these steps carefully:

##### Server Setup

1. Navigate to `parity-server` directory
2. Open `.env`
3. Configure according to the [server documentation](https://github.com/theblitlabs/parity-server)
4. Key focus areas:
   - Database configuration
   - Blockchain connection parameters
   - Network settings

##### Runner Setup

1. Navigate to `parity-runner` directory
2. Open `.env`
3. Configure according to the [runner documentation](https://github.com/theblitlabs/parity-runner)
4. Key focus areas:
   - Docker environment settings
   - Server connection parameters
   - Resource allocation limits

##### Client Setup

1. Navigate to `parity-client` directory
2. Open `.env`
3. Configure according to the [client documentation](https://github.com/theblitlabs/parity-client)
4. Key focus areas:
   - API configurations
   - Server connection details
   - Client-specific parameters

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Configuration Notes**:

- Verify all placeholder values are replaced with actual configurations
- Ensure no port conflicts between components
- Double-check file permissions
- Use secure values for authentication tokens and keys

#### 4. Launch Services

Run each component in a separate terminal window:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server
cd parity-server
make build
parity-server auth --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
parity-server

# Terminal 2: Runner
cd parity-runner
make build
parity-runner auth --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
parity-runner stake --amount 10
parity-runner

# Terminal 3: Client
cd parity-client
make build
parity-client
```
